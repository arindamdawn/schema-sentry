# Security Policy

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories.

- Go to https://github.com/arindamdawn/schema-sentry/security/advisories
- Click "New draft security advisory"
- Provide details and steps to reproduce

If advisories are unavailable, open a GitHub issue asking for a private contact channel.
